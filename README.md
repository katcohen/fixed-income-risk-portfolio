## 🚀 Projects

### 1. Factor Model & Risk Attribution (IG Credit) 
Developed a multi-factor risk model for U.S. investment-grade (IG) corporate bond portfolios:
- Ran OLS regressions with robust (HC3) standard errors of IG excess returns on key market factors (equity index, HY        credit beta, oil prices, and Treasury rate shifts).
- Conducted variance decomposition to identify the primary drivers of portfolio risk, quantifying factor contributions      vs. idiosyncratic risk.
- Produced attribution charts to highlight which macro/market exposures explain IG credit risk in different market          regimes.
  
### 2. Scenario & Stress Testing
- Parallel shifts, recession, higher-for-longer, and risk-off scenarios.
- Duration & spread duration impact on portfolio.
- Historical **VaR / Expected Shortfall** extensions.

### 3. Performance Attribution (High Yield)
- Brinson allocation/selection decomposition vs benchmark.
- Attribution reporting and alpha source identification.
