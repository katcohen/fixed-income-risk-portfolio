## 🚀 Projects

### 1. Factor Model & Risk Attribution (IG Credit) 
Developed a multi-factor risk model for U.S. investment-grade (IG) corporate bond portfolios:
- Ran OLS regressions with robust (HC3) standard errors of IG excess returns on key market factors (equity index, HY        credit beta, oil prices, and Treasury rate shifts).
- Conducted variance decomposition to identify the primary drivers of portfolio risk, quantifying factor contributions      vs. idiosyncratic risk.
- Produced attribution charts to highlight which macro/market exposures explain IG credit risk in different market          regimes.
  
### 2. Scenario & Stress Testing
Built a scenario and stress testing framework for a diversified fixed-income portfolio:
- Modeled parallel rate shifts, recession scenarios, higher-for-longer, and risk-off environments to test portfolio         resilience.
- Measured duration and spread duration impacts under shocks to interest rates and credit spreads.
- Extended analysis with historical Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall to capture tail risk exposures.
- Produced stress dashboards to visualize potential mark-to-market losses across scenarios.
  
### 3. Performance Attribution (High Yield
Performed performance attribution analysis on high-yield credit strategies:
- Applied Brinson-style allocation and selection decomposition to compare active positioning vs. benchmark.
- Quantified alpha sources by separating sector allocation effects from security selection skill.
- Generated attribution reports showing how much outperformance derived from top-down vs. bottom-up drivers.
