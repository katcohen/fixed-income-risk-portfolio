# Fixed-Income Model Portfolio — Analyst Memo  
**Analyst:** Katherine Cohen  

---

## Objective  
Review a diversified fixed-income portfolio built from liquid ETFs, highlight key risks, and suggest adjustments given today’s environment of persistent inflation, higher-for-longer policy rates, tariff pressures, and late-cycle economic risks.  

---

## Portfolio Snapshot  
- **Core Intermediate (AGG, 27%)**  
- **Multisector (BOND, 23%)**  
- **Short-Term (SHY, 13%)**  
- **IG Corporate (LQD, 7%)**  
- **World Hedged (BNDX, 6%)**  
- **Nontraditional/Unconstrained (TOTL, 7%)**  
- **High Yield (HYG, 5%)**  
- **Bank Loans (BKLN, 5%)**  
- **Ultrashort (ICSH, 4%)**  
- **Muni Intermediate (MUB, 3%)**

**Performance since 2015**  
- Annualized Return: **2.1%**  
- Annualized Volatility: **4.1%**  
- Max Drawdown: **–15%**  

---

## Key Takeaways  
- **Returns:** In line with high-quality bonds during a period that included the 2022 rate shock.  
- **Risk:** Moderate volatility; drawdowns tied to sharp rate moves.  
- **Credit vs. Rates:** Credit adds income but is cyclical; rate sensitivity dominates portfolio risk.  
- **Implementation:** ETF mix is diversified, liquid, and practical for advisors and model portfolios.  

---

## Recommendations  
1. **Manage Duration**  
   - Trim 3–5% from longer bonds (AGG/LQD/BNDX) into short-term or flexible strategies (SHY, ICSH, TOTL).  
   - If recession risks rise, shift back into Treasuries/TIPS and reduce high yield/loans.  

2. **Add Inflation Protection**  
   - Introduce a **2–4% TIPS allocation** to guard against tariff-driven inflation.  

3. **Be Disciplined on Credit**  
   - Keep high yield + loans near 10%. Use them for income, not for growth exposure.  

4. **Upgrade Monitoring**  
   - Add scenario tests (rate shocks, spread widening).  
   - Track rolling volatility, drawdowns, and yield metrics.  

---

## Risk Guardrails  
- **Target volatility:** 3.5–4.5%  
- **Max drawdown:** <10% through-cycle  
- **Credit cap:** HY + Loans ≤12%  
- **Rebalance:** Semi-annual or ±2% shifts  

---

## What to Watch  
- **Inflation:** If breakevens >2.5%, maintain inflation hedges.  
- **Growth:** If labor or ISM weakens, extend duration and cut credit.  
- **Yield Curve:**  
  - Weak growth with steepening → add duration.  
  - Inflation-driven steepening → reduce rate risk.
