Fixed-Income Model Portfolio — Analyst Memo

Analyst: Katherine Cohen

Objective

Review a diversified fixed-income portfolio built from liquid ETFs, highlight key risks, and suggest adjustments given today’s environment of persistent inflation, higher-for-longer policy rates, tariff pressures, and late-cycle economic risks.

Portfolio Snapshot

Core Intermediate (AGG, 27%)

Multisector (BOND, 23%)

Short-Term (SHY, 13%)

IG Corporate (LQD, 7%)

World Hedged (BNDX, 6%)

Nontraditional/Unconstrained (TOTL, 7%)

High Yield (HYG, 5%)

Bank Loans (BKLN, 5%)

Ultrashort (ICSH, 4%)

Muni Intermediate (MUB, 3%)

Performance since 2015: 2.1% annual return, 4.1% volatility, –15% max drawdown.

Key Takeaways

Returns: Consistent with high-quality bonds in a period that included the 2022 rate shock.

Risk: Moderate volatility but meaningful drawdowns when rates moved sharply higher.

Credit vs. Rates: Credit exposure adds income but is vulnerable if growth slows; rate sensitivity remains the dominant risk.

Implementation: The ETF set is diversified, liquid, and well-suited for advisors and model portfolios.

Recommendations

Manage Duration

Trim 3–5% from longer bonds (AGG/LQD/BNDX) into short-term or flexible strategies (SHY, ICSH, TOTL) to reduce rate sensitivity.

If recession risks rise, shift back into Treasuries/TIPS and reduce high yield/loans.

Add Inflation Protection

Introduce a 2–4% TIPS allocation to guard against tariff-driven inflation.

Be Disciplined on Credit

Keep high yield + loans near 10% of portfolio. Use them for income, not for growth exposure.

Upgrade Monitoring

Add scenario tests (rate shocks, spread widening) and track rolling volatility, drawdowns, and yield metrics.

Risk Guardrails

Target volatility: 3.5–4.5%

Max drawdown: <10% through-cycle

Credit cap: HY + Loans ≤12%

Rebalance: Semi-annual or ±2% shifts

What to Watch

Inflation measures: If breakevens >2.5%, keep inflation hedges.

Growth signals: If labor or ISM data weaken, extend duration and cut credit.

Yield curve shifts: Weak growth with steepening → add duration; inflation-driven steepening → reduce rate risk.
