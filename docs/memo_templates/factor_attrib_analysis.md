_Date: 2025-08-26_

## Executive Summary
Regression of a diversified FI portfolio (30% IEF, 30% LQD, 20% HYG, 10% EMB, 10% TIP) on level, slope, credit, and inflation factors shows:

- **Credit factor dominates** (≈ 96% variance share).
- **Slope** is modest but statistically significant (beta ≈ -0.009).
- **Level** and **Inflation** factors explain very little variance.

## Key Findings
- Portfolio is most sensitive to **credit spread risk**.
- Slope exposure indicates vulnerability to **curve flatteners**.
- Rate level (10Y) and breakeven inflation add minimal explanatory power.

## Implications
- Portfolio is essentially a **credit beta trade**.
- Oversight recommendation: introduce **rate hedges** (Treasuries) or reduce HY/IG tilt to balance risk.
- Next step: monitor rolling betas to capture regime shifts.
