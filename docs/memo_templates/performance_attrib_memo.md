# High Yield Portfolio Performance Attribution — Analyst Memo  

**Date:** August 25, 2025  
**Analyst:** Katherine Cohen  

## Executive Summary  
We performed a Brinson-style attribution of HY portfolio performance relative to a benchmark.  
- Active return of **{{8%}}** driven by allocation and selection effects.  
- **Selection** in {{sleeve}} was the primary alpha source.  
- **Allocation** effects reflect overweight/underweight positions vs benchmark.  

## Methodology  
- Benchmark: HY composite index.  
- Portfolio sleeves: HY Core, HY Short Duration, EM Bonds.  
- Attribution components:  
  - **Allocation Effect:** (Portfolio weight – Benchmark weight) × Benchmark return  
  - **Selection Effect:** Benchmark weight × (Portfolio return – Benchmark return)  
  - **Interaction Effect:** Combined effect of allocation & selection  

## Results  
| Component     | Contribution (bps) | Commentary |  
|---------------|---------------------|------------|  
| Allocation    | {{-3.0}} | Positive from overweight in {{sleeve}}. |  
| Selection     | {{13.0}} | Strong alpha in {{sleeve}}. |  
| Interaction   | {{-2.0}} | Secondary impact. |  
| Active Return | {{8.0}} | Total portfolio alpha vs benchmark. |  

## Interpretation  
- Positive selection indicates security/sector picks outperformed the benchmark sleeves.
- Allocation detracted due to underweight in {bench sleeve} during a strong month.
- Next steps: validate over multiple months (time-series attribution) and link to sleeve-level risk exposures.  

## Implications & Actions  
- Reinforce alpha sleeves; reduce unintended exposures.  
- Monitor tracking error and concentration risk.  
- Extend to multi-period attribution to confirm persistence of alpha.
