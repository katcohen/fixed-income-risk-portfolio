# High Yield Portfolio Performance Attribution — Analyst Memo  

**Date:** August 25, 2025  
**Analyst:** Katherine Cohen  

## Executive Summary  
We performed a Brinson-style attribution of HY portfolio performance relative to a benchmark.  
- Active return of **8%** driven by allocation and selection effects.  
- **Selection** in {{sleeve}} was the primary alpha source.  
- **Allocation** effects reflect overweight/underweight positions vs benchmark.  

## Methodology  
- Benchmark: HY composite index.  
- Portfolio sleeves: HY Core, HY Short Duration, EM Bonds.  
- Attribution components:  
  - **Allocation Effect:** (Portfolio weight – Benchmark weight) × Benchmark return (w_P − w_B) × r_B 
  - **Selection Effect:** Benchmark weight × (Portfolio return – Benchmark return)  w_B × (r_P − r_B)
  - **Interaction Effect:** Combined effect of allocation & selection (w_P − w_B) × (r_P − r_B)

## Results  
| Component     | Contribution (bps) | Commentary |  
|---------------|---------------------|------------|  
| Allocation    | -3.0 | Positive from overweight in worst allocation sleeve. |  
| Selection     | 13.0 | Strong alpha in top allocation sleeve. |  
| Interaction   | -2.0 | Secondary impact. |  
| Active Return |  8.0 | Total portfolio alpha vs benchmark. |  

## Interpretation  
- Positive selection indicates security/sector picks outperformed the benchmark sleeves.
- Allocation detracted, implying an underweight to a strong sleeve or an overweight to a laggard. 

## Implications & Actions  
- Reinforce alpha sleeves; reduce unintended exposures.  
- Monitor tracking error and concentration risk.  
- Extend to multi-period attribution to confirm persistence of alpha.
